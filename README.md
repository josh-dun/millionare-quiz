Who wants to be a millionaire in pygame :))))))

Press "m" and there will be a money board move down, type "m" again and it will move up
Press "t" to take money and you won the game 
Press "s" to show or to open shortcut instructions 

last thing:
if you have an error in an import imgage like this:
  x_image = pygame.image.load(join("../images", "unable.png"))

that because you using different ide from me
just try:
  x_image = pygame.image.load(join("images", "unable.png"))

Hope you enjoy :))))
